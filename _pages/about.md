I'm currently in my first year of my PhD at the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, in the Quantum Information Theory group led by Antonio Acin.

My research interests revolve around the intersection between machine learning and quantum physics. In particular, I'm most interested in i) applications of machine learning to quantum information and quantum computing, and ii) novel implementations of deep learning models in quantum hardware.
