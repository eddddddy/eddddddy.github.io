I am currently in my last year of undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo and expected to graduate in Spring 2022 with a major in computer science and minors in combinatorics and optimization, pure math, and physics.

My research interests revolve around the intersection between machine learning and quantum physics. In particular, I'm most interested in i) applications of machine learning to quantum physics and ii) implementations of machine learning models (specifically deep learning models) in quantum hardware.
